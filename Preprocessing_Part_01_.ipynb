The problem with tweaking the recycled programs is that these tweaked programs only appear inferior to the original programs like in the case of the FS of Sui Han. Their 207 4CC and WC program of Bridge Over Troubled Water was a great classic already and so far, the 2021 BOTW performances, with some innovations, did not create the emotional moments that they created in 2017. I hope they improved the lifts in time for the Olympics in 2022. This great Chinese pair deserves an olympic gold medal for years of great performances.

Yes back a couple years ago I would’ve called him soft or weak, I’ve tried to be more understanding of people’s mental stuff, despite not believing in some of it. I do think there are a lot of mentally weak people but I don’t think Carey Price is one of those people. I mean clearly he has mental toughness, he’s been the Canadiens goalie for years and years and years, that’s a tough place to play and he’s been incredibly consistent.

The Japanese government is in a position to allow the Rising Sun flag at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.  They maintain the attitude that &quot;they have no political intent and are merely a flag widely used in Japan.&quot;<br><br> The Rising Sun Flag, which was the flag of the former Japanese Empire in the 19th century, is remembered as a “symbol of Japanese militarism” in Korea and China, which were victims of Japanese military aggression in the 20th century.  The Japanese government is using the flag symbolizing war crimes even though it has not paid due compensation to the victims and has not fully reflected on its own history.  In fact, the Rising Sun Flag is the flag of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, and is the flag used by far-right forces in Japan.<br><br> For this reason, the South Korean government has criticized the “Rising Sun Flag as a flag of hatred.” An associate professor of history at the University of Hawaii, analyzed Japan&#39;s behavior, saying, &quot;The current Japanese government has been neglecting the rise of extreme nationalist forces and has been using nationalist expressions politically.&quot;. .', 'comment_like_count': 1}\n",

We&#39;re judged every single day of our lives. And I think it says something about figure skating that people in any LGBTQ+ or any minority, invisible minority in particular don&#39;t feel safe to be who they are.&quot; I really think this is a skating-centric issue. Nowhere else are practice sessions used by judges to &#39;get a feel&#39; for where athletes are. Theatre actors can be whoever they are in private as long as they portray a character convincingly on stage. Hopefully, skating will start getting better at focusing exclusively on the competitive performance at hand -rather than &#39;packaging&#39; official practice sessions, picking outfits for skating order draws and other similar nonsense.', 'comment_like_count': 11}\n",

This was a big reason I was against skating in the Olympics. If you&#39;re only gonna show 8 people then do a couple more contests outside the Olympics and get the people you&#39;re looking for. The nyjahs, the Shane O&#39;Neills, luan Oliveras. If you want street league competitors just hold street league at the Olympics. We don&#39;t need another xgames game of skate when the berrics do it best. We don&#39;t need an Olympic event if you just want street league riders. Just put the SL Crown Cup in the Olympics every four years and you&#39;ll have the same best of the best. <br><br>My fear was the Olympics were just gonna be another xgames marketing off skateboarding and have no soul and after hearing that it all seems like a shell game.

Toronto Arenas are NOT the same franchise as Toronto St. Patricks. Toronto Arenas actually folded on February 20th, 1919 because of poor attendance and financial difficulties at the Mutual Street Arena. The St. Patricks were an existing amateur hockey club. They paid Frank Calder (who pocketed the money for himself) in order to join the National Hockey League. The St. Patricks owners did not buy the Toronto Arenas franchise. Only 4 players made the jump from Toronto Arenas to Toronto St. Patricks. Toronto Maple Leafs have absolutely no right to claim the history of Toronto Arenas as their own. Conn Smythe did buy the St. Patricks franchise and renamed the club Maple Leafs in 1927...so it is alright for Maple Leafs to claim the history of the St. Patricks as their own. BTW....there has not been a rivalry between Canadiens and Maple Leafs since the late 1960s.', 'comment_like_count': 1}\n",

But I think the leafs will probably get 2-3 wins... Because all the games in the season between both of them were close and we were missing half of our top 6, a top 2 defender and the best goalie in the league. I don’t think the leafs would have won those games if they had all those players hurt and we didn’t... + I don’t know if Campbell will be able to play like a top goalie in the playoffs because Andersen doesn’t... the players don’t as well ! On the other side, the Habs are known to be somewhat dangerous in the playoffs because of being the underdogs. Price is very good when he is well rested and he’s coming in the playoffs with like a month break... The team will be happy + motivated when Gallagher returns and they will play even harder ( when he plays the team wins a lot more than when he doesn’t... Weber will be back too so the leadership is going to be back ! Drouin and Danault might not be back but maybe in the second round and if it’s against Edmonton I think it will be no more than 5 games because Mcdavid doesn’t do anything against Danault and Price. The leafs and the fans think it’s going to be really easy and it’s crazy cause all the games have been really tight and we have been missing players and it will if they beat MTL they pretty much are already in the third round but we all know the Leafs can’t make it passed round one... but anyways it’s going to be a crazy matchup and the games will be extremely fun to watch !', 'comment_like_count': 2}\n",

Again in real-time, the hit is a little late but not much, and it&#39;s certainly not &quot;20 minutes&quot; after he dished the puck! Playoffs are tough, Finals are tougher. You keep your head up. Again pretty sure he had to answer for this on the next play he was involved in.<br>6. You admit he got suspended for 2 games for this one.<br>7. You admit he got 4 games.<br>8. You admit he got 7 games.<br>9. Guy had the puck, wasn&#39;t looking up as he was skating down the blue line, any hockey player knows you&#39;re putting yourself at risk on a play like that. And even then, he got 20 games for it like you said.<br>10. He got fined, penalized on the play, and had to answer the bell the next chance the opposition got.<br><br>The only case you&#39;re actually making is that Wilson usually (in 7/10 of the examples YOU compiled) gets reprimanded by the league and DoPS and often has to answer the bell for his actions. Yet you frame it by acting like the DoPS has done nothing and you act like the players themselves have no agency. I myself would never do what Tom Wilson does, but I don&#39;t go acting like I don&#39;t understand why he does what he does or trying to stir up drama about it.<br><br>This knee-jerk &quot;I&#39;m gonna get upset over a situation that&#39;s already taken care of itself&quot; mentality is just silly. If you wanna go do something about Wilson, lace up the skates and try to make the NHL yourself. See how that goes for ya.<br><br>And the CBC should hire less lazy writers if this is what they come up with.', 'comment_like_count': 1}\n",

He did some dangerous stuff tonight on 1 player half his size Panarin, that never fights, he knows that and he had another player Pavel Buchnevich #89 on the ground with his stick around under his neck holding him down while punching him in the back of the head. Panarin is the guy that he tried to put through the ice and he didn&#39;t come back for the 3rd period cause he was injured from Wilson. The hits to the back of the head though aren&#39;t even allowed in an MMA fight. Sportsmanlike fights are part of hockey &amp; can be easily broken up usually, have rules and then you go about your penalties and continue. Tom Wilson is about trying to kill someone. He&#39;s always getting suspended. Way too much for the NHL and it&#39;s a bad look for the league to not do something about him. If they don&#39;t we won&#39;t be allowed to have any physicality or regular fights at all. He has to at least be suspended for the rest of the season. At least.', 'comment_like_count': 14}\n",

Excuse me if I&#39;m mistaken, but Vanessa has yet to address the Cipres&#39; situation (which, let me remind you, is a case of sexual abuse on a MINOR, and there may be other victims) that happened at their own rink. I can&#39;t imagine Vanessa not being aware of that situation considering that her coaches were involved in the scandal, plus she kept skating with Morgan even after the news were out!! Vanessa is a role model for so many young skaters and I can&#39;t believe she hasn&#39;t said a word about this as if it didn&#39;t matter. This sport is full of abuse and deserves people standing up against it. On the other hand, Eric, (who let&#39;s remember composed a song in tribute to another very potential abuser in the sport!! what a great team they make together with vanessa then) uses the excuse of &quot;Meagan got pregnant again, and I knew that I had to find a plan B&quot; to completely avoid saying that he just didn&#39;t want to skate with her anymore. Man tried to contact Aljona Savchenko lmao, who, guess what, was also pregnant around the time Eric wanted to change partners. mm, that excuse of pregnancy is quite suspicious then. It also is really hard to hear when you know that Meagan had been pregnant before, skated while pregnant and started skating again just a month or two after the birth and landed jumps again like it was nothing !! she has proved before that she was a committed partner, idk how and why he doubted her like that. He also said he didn&#39;t know that this new partnership was actually going to work out until two weeks ago, but then it is also known that they started skating and preparing together since last year !! he apparently &quot;didn&#39;t expect&quot; the ffsg to actually accept the release of vanessa.. please. On top of that, the way he handled the situation with Meagan was extremely disappointing ; he did this behind her back, did not notify her at all (or even ask her if she would consider a comeback at all, even though she said herself recently that she wouldn&#39;t have) until two weeks ago when he found out about ffsg releasing Vanessa. idk if it&#39;s just me but maybe you could have discussed this with your &quot;soulmate on ice&quot; before you do it ? i understand that because of the pregnancy he feared that Meagan wouldn&#39;t be able to skate for ice shows leaving him without a source of income, but.. it was also her only source of income. it was literally an issue for the both of them, so the least to do was to talk about it with her. Eric and Vanessa..Both of them together is really funny to me and as much as I may want to appreciate them, I won&#39;t be able to. Also really funny to come back on Olympics season, considering that they haven&#39;t been the team to own the spots there but are likely to go there instead of a team who did. And yes this is a sport so who is best will go to the Olympics, I get it, this is just my opinion and I just find this situation a  bit unfair and sad. I guess we have to wait and what happens next season. Anyway, I won&#39;t be watching them skate ; I can&#39;t bring myself to do it. I just wanted to say this here because people seem so happy about them coming back ; either they didn&#39;t know about all of this, didn&#39;t remember, or completely ignored it (to which if that&#39;s the case, I find it infuriating but well).

Nathan is definitely a favorite for gold in Beijing 2022, but then again, so is Yuma. Like I said in the video for the men&#39;s SP, anyone can make mistakes, and here, Yuzuru did. There&#39;s a rumor of him having an asthma attack and not having his inhaler with him, but like the champion he is, didn&#39;t make excuses for his poor performance. I think training the 4A in Japan, then coming to Sweden and having no rest day in between the Short and Free programs just did not help him. Again, this is not even a real season - the pandemic disrupted so much for everyone. Anyways, I always never worried about Nathan, because in the end, USA will have 3 spots for Worlds and Olympics next year. Yuzuru did his job, getting spots for Yuma and Shoma and whoever else will be in Beijing next year. Glad that Keegan Messing got Canada spots! I hope Roman and Nam can make it to Beijing.', 'comment_like_count': 15}\n",

Disappointed to see Yuzuru make so many mistakes in the Free Skate, but the reality is that his programs were not really good enough to challenge Chen unless Chen makes mistakes. Even in the SP that he won, it was not his usual standard and the clear indication of the lack of positivity was doing only a level three step sequence rather than level 4. Even with a clean Free Skate I doubt that the content would have put him within 8 points of Chen, needs to cut out the mistakes, improve the content and pick music more suited to his artistic style.', 'comment_like_count': 16}\n",

He seems to have everything to be a complete package.  I don&#39;t think Nathan will compete on ice for much longer after the Olympics next year.

He said that once he did not nail his skating on ice, he could always come back to fix it, but that wasn&#39;t the case at school.  He majors in one of the hardest and most competitive disciplines, data science/statistics (which is known as the foundation of AI), and has eyes on med school later.  That demands a lot more investment of both time and focus.  I don&#39;t think he can do that and still continue to compete in figure skating.

Karen Chen program was better, but then let’s do a simple comparison and take the first place and the forth (Anna and Karen); it might be just my opinion, but they were like the heaven and earth, respectively. Yes, Karen had a clean program, but technically it was objectively weaker, and she did look heavier and more tired than Anna, for example.

Elizabeth fought for her silver medal, thanks to her triple axle but let’s talk about Rika of Japan, I don’t advise people to change program last minute, she didn’t try the quad and had so much errors , maybe she was nervous, her performance was shocking to me. But the cleanest program was Karen Chen, omg she is the best spinner I have seen and her spiral and smiles, I wish she has a quad or triple axle but let’s see what the men will bring.

She was my favorite overall because she didn&#39;t make any noticeable mistakes, had a beautiful fan and arabesque spiral, lovely centering, speed and flexibility in her spins, graceful and expressive arms and facial expressions, very little pre-rotation on her lofty jumps which actually have more rotation than those with massive pre=rotation, a proper triple lutz edge and she had a lot of maturity in her delivery with good speed and commitment. A nice balance between grace and power and she gave me flashbacks of Lu Chen&#39;s lovely Butterfly Lovers performance at the 1998 Olympics.  I also enjoyed Kaori and Leona overall and enjoyed Haien Lee&#39;s artistry but she had some tech issues. Lost interest in the bean counting and highly biased system that always privileges the same favorites since Sochi but I do think the Russian skaters are very talented and resilient in the face of pressure. Liza&#39;s fight to make it back is inspiring, Anna is graceful and amazingly consistent on jumps, and Sasha lands some impressive quads. However, It&#39;s just hard to cheer for those who are repeatedly given such scoring preference, especially since Lackernick has had his hand on the lever of ISU power for so long from being one of the main architects for the COP system, to being head tech controller making all the tech rules, to being head of the Russian skating federation and now de facto head of figure skating. As an example of the influence, remember the power, play tech memo only a year and a half ago and then all the preferential tech calls that followed as an example. At thius point in time, I just decide which performance I like best in my own eyes. Would like to see regional and national competitions even Russian ones just not altogether at Worlds or the Olympics where the bias becomes so obvious.', 'comment_like_count': 2}\n",

I realized at that moment that professional sport was  not Sport but was a Business and Entertainment (just like a movie or theatre, etc).  The rose coloured glasses were removed.   I stopped watching hockey at the end of that game for 20 years.  I refused to watch Game 7.  I know Gretzky was traded to Los Angeles to help the business of hockey and rightly so,  and He did.  But for a true sports person, this was the game that showed me the light of Professional Sports... its 3 hours of time that takes you away from real life.  <br>For people that weren&#39;t following hockey that year, this was monumental. To refresh everyone&#39;s memory,  high sticking infractions were targeted that year specifically. To reduce high sticks but the penalties were severe.  Gretzky&#39;s high stick on Doug Gilmour should have been a 5 minute penalty,  plus Gretzky would have been kicked out for that game and, if my recollection is correct,  he would have missed the next game too.  An argument was made that it may have just been a double minor penalty...  not that it matters,  as the penalty wasn&#39;t called. <br>My thought was that the &quot;missed call&quot; was actually a &quot;business decision&quot; (marketing),  not a &quot;sports decision&quot;.<br>It was the correct one for hockey in general,  for the advancement of hockey in the USA, but not the rules of true sport.

I do love seeing Turandot and Scheherazade programs, though. R&amp;J is pretty much a rite of passage program for any upcoming skater to use, but yeah, it can be annoying to see skaters use and abuse this music over and over. Carmen is pretty much Katarina Witt&#39;s (Zagitova&#39;s I don&#39;t really enjoy; Kolyada&#39;s was a nice interpretation for a guy).

So that is why he is doing this: his primary focus is to run a club and being also a player spares him some resources.<br><br>He is not already 100 per cent into it, this season he noted he is a bit overweight and not playing the level he wanted, but had no other choice than playing, as they had too few players due to injuries and covid issues.<br><br>Simply put: you can tell he has retired already, his mind is being a manager. Other players would have fun playing some beer league, but his level of skill is so high that with almost same attitude he can play pro-league for few more years. Remember Petr Nedved?

No matter how expressive his arms are, which unfortunately current skaters and choreographers (on both men and women’s sides) mistaken as “artistry”, it takes more than flailing arms to express artistry.  Perhaps it’s age and life experience, but all performers need to understand the power of motion, why your arms move a certain way in connection with the rest of your body and the context you are in.  Furthermore, from a purely visual perspective, how your arm movement affects the visual representation of your body.  Nathan is perhaps still too young and needs probably a different life experience and a different coach to understand what he has done well and what he still needs to grow.

The statistical average number of goals scored per game per team in the NHL between 2005 to 2019 when Ovechkin played in his first 14 seasons was 2.838 goals.  That&#39;s a 32% difference which means that it is statistically 32% more difficult to score goals in the modern era compared to back in the 80&#39;s and early 90&#39;s.  <br><br>When people only look at a 1:1 goal comparison between Gretzky&#39;s total goals and Ovechkin&#39;s total goals, its like comparing a sprinter who is running on flat level surface to that of a sprinter running uphill on an incline.  Ovechkin&#39;s modern era goal total needs to be calibrated by 32% in order to properly compare to Gretzky&#39;s goal total:  700 goals x 1.32 = 924 goals &gt; Gretzky&#39;s 894 goals.  And that&#39;s even before adding in the 50 goals Ovechkin would have certainly scored in the 2004/2005 lockout season.  <br><br>It really puts into perspective what Ovechkin has achieved in the modern NHL era while even having played one less season than Gretzky, and Ovechkin still has 5 or 6 seasons left to play still.  It&#39;s like catching up to the fastest sprinter in history after having a late start, while running against an incline, and then passing that fastest sprinter while there is still a quarter length of track remaining.<br><br>Just look at the difference between goalies from the 80&#39;s and goalies in the modern NHL era.  Look at the difference in their size of pads, height, reach, flexibility, technique, and skill.  Most goalies from the 80&#39;s played worse than today&#39;s amateur beer league goalies.  During Gretzky&#39;s first 14 seasons, the average NHL goalie save % was 0.879 and the average GAA was 3.65, which is unheard of among today&#39;s modern era NHL goalies, except maybe in the minors.  Also, no players bothered to block shots back in the 80&#39;s, imagine how many more goals Ovechkin would have if players played 80&#39;s style defense and did not bother to block shots. <br><br>Also, Gretzky played on a decade-long dynasty team in an era that had no salary cap.  The 80&#39;s Oilers Dynasty fab 5 would have never been allowed to exist on the same team after the salary cap was put in place starting in 2006 during Ovechkin&#39;s first season.  Ovechkin played every single season under a limiting cap which made the league way more competitive and evenly distributed, Gretzky never did, not even a single season.', 'comment_like_count': 64}\n",

Ovechkin does not possess the same passion and commitment that gretzky had to the game and Ovechkin&#39;s personality will not allow other influences to dictate his judgement about his career. Besides the pandemic causing delays to his performance pace, Karma could cause a huge injury to him and he doesn&#39;t even participate in All-Star games anymore.  Keep in mind too that Gretzky broke that 801 goal record 2 years YOUNGER than Ovechkin is NOW and Gretzky was only adding to it for 6 more seasons. Ovechkin will be doing the total opposite: trying to catch that 894 record at the very end of his career so there is a difference. I think if Ovechkin had career 830 goals and he needed to play 2 more seasons to break the record nearing 40, he would not play just to satisfy the hockey world. It just comes down to PERSONALITY, and i think he is more indifferent to the record than the pressure from others wanting him to break it. Besides being wealthy enough to buy a small country, I can&#39;t see him playing 4 or 5 more years just to please others. Sorry folks, i just don&#39;t see it.', 'comment_like_count': 1}\n",

If you go by free program scores, Trusovo is supposed to be 35 points better than Satoko in technical skills but Satoko is only 3 points better than Sasha in skating skills and artistic impression. That is just wrong. By that metric, Satoko should be 20 points better in PCS. I think Sasha rightly won the comp, but the scores don&#39;t reflect their abilities.

Could have intro them by saying two of the best in their sport, together for 5 years, recently expanded their family of three (Nia has a 7 (?) year old) with the birth of their first child together. Odd interview, could be he did address it but the editor sucked. It would have nice to learn more about them and the challenges of two top athletes with a newborn, schedules, injuries and supporting each other through the ups and downs of competition.

I saw his performances at the Worlds Championship and honestly, to me It looked like he still has that amazing closing speed and acceleration, but for some reason he was holding back. <br><br>Go watch both the 100m and 200m finals where he finished in 3rd and 2nd place respectively, He&#39;s not even breathing as hard as everyone else on the field before, during or even after the race when you expect everyone to be gasping for air.   He&#39;s just calm and relaxed as usual, but a little too relaxed if you ask me. He&#39;s clearly not putting in maximum effort into these races. Hell, he doesn&#39;t even lean for the line as hard as he used to, he just kinda tilts his head forward a little bit. <br><br>I think maybe he&#39;s choosing not to exert as much force trough his legs like he use to because he thinks that the over-exertion of said force is what broke his hamstring before. In all likelyhood, he&#39;s thinking all this subconsciouly and needs to get over that mental block.

(Lots of which have been on the team for several seasons, some all-time veterans, and others are rookies or past players and Hall Of Fame inductees).<br><br><br>I personally on a site note don&#39;t like dirty play style, but Brad Marchand&#39;s style I support. It&#39;s a physical contact sport, you play it knowing that and the consequences that can follow (injury, which could lead to the ending of a short lived career). We are getting to soft with penalties and what we consider now to be rough, hockey is a rough sport, if you can take the heat, get off the ice! Does he play dirty and around the rules, yes, are they worth suspensions and fines, most of the time (when it involves spearing, licking and slew footing, but not hip checks at the knee, I see that to perfectly, 100% okay). Players back in the mid 1900&#39;s and when we had the &#39;Original Six&#39;, were making dirty plays, yes there were less regulation and rules when the league first started up, but he does it in a way that is around (in most cases) where a penalty can be given, but finds loopholes within the rule book to come up with ways to intimidate and wear down opponents where major penalties and fines as well as suspensions aren;t as common, he is creative. Without these aspects of his play style, he is one of the most tremendous hockey left wing players, and overall one of the greatest to play the game (Krejci, Chara &amp; Bergeron included) and to my belief deserved a higher spot as a final 3 nominee contender towards winning the MVP &#39;Hart Memorial Trophy&#39;, but was cut short. And the whole &#39;Rat&#39; joke I find a bit funny, I&#39;m cool with it, for I can see where you could see it, but to me, he is a handsome Canadian man! I do highly respect the side that you present though, if I wasn&#39;t a Bruin fan that can see his pros to his cons as I do, and I&#39;m a fan of a different team or just a overall side-line fan with support to a single team, I&#39;d be with you on it! In no way am I retaliating against your points or tone, just giving my side of the argument as a fan of the Bruins since childhood. I liked the video and the points you gave, it was well done! We can only imagine as hockey fans what the amount of respect would be like for Marchand (within the hockey fan-base) if he played with more sportsmanship, less disrespectful actions, and regarded the personal health of his opponents by keeping himself composed and self aware not to make such brutal choices in regard to his moves and take-downs he puts on them... but then he wouldn&#39;t be the player I know &amp; love today!', 'comment_like_count': 11}\n",

Also, what she has done as an NCAA college gymnast (I know UCLA is not a Canadian school; I’m not sure if Canadian Colleges/Universities have gymnastics, but she is a Canadian athlete who still represents Canada) is absolutely incredible! Overcoming that injury and the subsequent surgery, recovery and rehab while maintaining her studies and still contributing to her team as a leader to retain her full ride scholarship, only to start training again and find out her ACL was gone and she would need to go through knee surgery and recovery a second time. She worried about keeping her gymnastics scholarship and must have been devastated, but Miss Val was behind her, knowing what a dedicated, strong willed, positive person Peng is (saying she never complained and never once threw herself a pity party, keeping her fun loving positivity and dedication to being a leader for her team) and provided her support and allow her to push through a second major surgery, recovery, and rehab. She had already overcome what to many would have been a career ending back injury the year before her senior elite debut. 10 perfect 10’s in her career, 2018 Honda Sports Award, PAC-12 Woman of the Year, PAC-12 Scholar-Athlete of the Year, amongst her career highlights and accomplishments. Miss Val quote: “Peng Peng Lee’s Six year’s at UCLA (she was a double red shirt senior as she had to sit out the first two years recovering from ACL reconstructive surgeries, so was allowed to red shirt and compete a full four years/seasons) have been defined by perseverance through hardship, grace under pressure, positive leadership, and exuberance for the sport of gymnastics. She is always there when her team needs her. She is a pure example of how to live life with positivity and appreciation, maintaining the same zest for life seen in her performances through it all.” That can be said of her junior and senior elite career as well.  Iron sharpens iron, and her strong leadership skills and rock solid support of her teammates, even as she deals with personal devastation impacted those on her team, who credit her lead by example, positive attitude, strong character, hard work, and determination to overcome what some told her was impossible made them better gymnasts and team players. She pays homage to former Canadian and  UCLA gymnast Leah Homma with her beam mount-the Homma Flairs, which is unique and beautiful. I think she performs them better than anyone I’ve seen! Her bars and beam are ON POINT! Anyways, sorry for the novel, brevity is not my strong point. I just think she should be included, because she has done Canada proud and she is proud to represent 🇨🇦I’m not Canadian, but her story has inspired and moved me, and brings me to tears. Sarah Burke and Joanie Rochette also make me well up with tears. Sarah Burke changed the Olympics, and her Olympic legacy is cemented despite passing away in a training accident before getting to compete in the Olympic event she made a reality and opportunity for others.

Biggest example is me migrating to Australia from India and hustling through the process. Basketball is my biggest desire at the moment and I guess when u just get too much of anything it starts to lose its value. Like they play so much that they seek out for other things. Thats just being human nature, when u get one thing u go after another and sometimes u cant have all things at the same time, but its just going after whats more important.

There was talk even before the Olympics, that the 10 barrier needed breaking, reasoning it didn&#39;t make sense no one had ever achieved a perfect 10. I mean, how can you say 10 is the highest score you can get, if no one ever got one. So anyway, we knew it might occur, we just didn&#39;t know who would make it happen. The reality, imo: her uneven parallel bar routine was lovely, but pretty rudimentary throughout and way too short. Even the dismount was unimpressive compared to the crazy dismounts being done today. In today&#39;s world, she didn&#39;t have elements of a difficulty in her routine, to justify a 10. That said, her balance beam routines were insanely beautiful and worth every bit of 10 by the standards of the time. The fact of the matter is though, none of her routines then, contain enough elements or difficulty to even be scored at a modern day Olympics. She would be disqualified for all their missing elements. By comparison, this routine was done yesterday: <br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuVsxQ8hZIs\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuVsxQ8hZIs</a>', 'comment_like_count': 0}\n",

What would you say if we said the same for P/C? <br>V/M  have won with the same scores all this year, on every different competition, it is constant. They are better than before, they have a lot of experience, and P/C fans (of which I am too) will see that in a few years, P/C will have improved, and they will understand why they didn&#39;t win this year. I couldn&#39;t understand before this year why V/M lost against D/W in 2014, but i see this year that they have technically improve, and now I understand that their level was not enough before.<br>I don&#39;t doubt that next year, it will be a great competition between these two couples.

There is something so intimate and sexy about it.  Maybe because that is a vulnerable position and you wouldn’t normally let people do that.  They are in hand to neck,  hand to shoulder and hand to waist positions a lot.  Again, intimate... not to mention technically difficult because you have to skate closer than a hand to hand position where you’re further apart and there’s less chance of tripping over each other. Watch the program again for this. They’ve always skated like this even when they were teenagers.  And pay attention to how often Scott brushes her cheek throughout the performance.  Not just this performance, but in a lot of their performances... again, since teenagers.', 'comment_like_count': 2}\n",

Both his hands and a knee touched the ice to keep him from crashing completely. It also happened as they were coming out of an element, which should have affected the points earned for it. It also broke the flow of the program and yet, they won! <br><br>It reminds me of the 2011 Grand Prix Final SD where Moir (again) fell flat on his back and although they were more than five points behind Davis and White going into the FD, the judges made up nearly ALL those points for V&amp;M in the FD, leaving Davis and White to win by only 0.05 when the margin should have been much wider. Outrageous. Five points is an insurmountable lead in ice dance and yet, it just proves, as does his competition, how certain judges were always there to &quot;help&quot; them and how they were over-scored for much of their career. Obviously, someone wanted to give them the advantage of being World Champions going into the Peyongchang Olympics because P&amp;C had been defeating them pretty consistently.', 'comment_like_count': 0}\n",

The score of PCs, V/M got 58.11 after that ugly fell and shitty twizzle compared to 58.36 which P/C&#39;s perfect and moved performance.  The score details of the judges panel, judge5 was totally corrupted who gave V/M three 10 in their PCs, while only one 10 to P/C. Also Judge 2 and Judge 7 who also gave higher PCs to V/M than P/C. Those blind and bias judges seems didn&#39;t care any mistakes made by V/M and put higher scores on them. The PCs examine skaters&#39; skating skills, transitions and performance which the V/M were all lacked in this performance. So ridiculous those corrupted judges gave them higher PCs. Back to technic panel, Still the Judge 5, who gave +1 GOE on that step sequence fell, and corrupted judge 7 even gave them +2 GOE, also this judge 7 gave P/C +2 GOE on twizzle but gave V/M +3, even normal people can see how bad V/M&#39;s twizzle was, Scott was not on balance and the last one even was not synchronized, compared to P/C&#39;s perfect twizzle. So, overall, those scam judges need to be fired from the ISU and shame on those bias and unfair judges. The fair non-inflated FD score for V/M in this FD is 111 the most, 116? what a joke!

And I&#39;m just like no no no no of course many of the reasons why we think there together is because of there strong bond and what they have with each other is so special on the ice but we also mean off the ice how the interact with each other and Scott actually looks at T like she&#39;s the only thing that matters and vice versa and it&#39;s so frustrating that they don&#39;t get what we see on and off ice but maybe they do since there both so private but what I think I know there not together but what I say is there not together but their in love with each other not dictating their life I don&#39;t watch them just because of how good the look together or how I would die if they were a couple I watch for how they move together there synchronicity there story telling I can tell when they fall out of character and make it about them which makes there performances so much better and that&#39;s what locks people in not the characters they potray but the love in there&#39;s eyes it&#39;s all there I don&#39;t know how they could compare each other to companions since there all they&#39;ve know for almost 22 years now can&#39;t you believe that    they obviously treasure each other so much you know what amazes me Tessa declined a very popular ballet school so she could skate with Scott like what that&#39;s insane they kept asking and she kept on denying saying she was already committed to Scott at such a young age I just really hope they just try to work it out of course I don&#39;t know what goes on BTS but we do have access to there media social life and from the looks of it I always see Heart eyes from Shape of you, to Carmen, to Moulin Rouge and every program they do even there off the ice times they just owe it to there selves not us but it&#39;s always been for them and that&#39;s how it should be', 'comment_like_count': 11}\n",

I think they are the best of the best at ice dancing and their artistry pushes their performances into an area no one else can match.  So many factors came together to make them the magical duo that they are - it&#39;s almost unbelievable.  <br><br>I just have one comment that is a little negative.  I wish so much that Tessa would get a consultant to teach her what kind of clothes are flattering to her body shape.  She is so beautiful and, in casual clothes, she looks great but whenever she is doing an important interview or something where she dresses up in a special outfit, the style that she chooses is frequently one that has a strong horizontal neckline across her shoulders (as with her sweater in this video).  <br><br>Tessa has very broad, square, athletic shoulders which are beautiful but should not be emphasized.  Just like women with broad hips learn not to wear horizontal stripes or pants and blouses that create a horizontal line at hip level, Tessa should never wear horizontal lines on her upper body.  This style makes her look too masculine, makes her head look small and detracts from her beauty.  <br><br>The sweater here isn&#39;t too bad since it&#39;s very close to her skin color and that keeps it from having a strong impact but I have seen some dresses and blouses that were quite unfortunate.  A good color consultant would be great, too, for her personal clothes and for her costumes. Please, Tessa, don&#39;t ever wear yellow again.  The unitard was awesome, though!<br><br>And I love the longer hair on Scott!', 'comment_like_count': 42}\n",
